# Data-Representation-And-Querying

#**Introduction**
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Galway City Beaches" available at https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-beaches

#The CSV File
This dataset was received in Comma Separated Values (CSV), I downloaded it from https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-beaches. The CSV file contains 50 rows.

The headings are as follows:
* X - X Coordinate
* Y - Y Coordinate
* ObjectID - ID of beach 1-4
* Name - Name of beach
* Lat - Latitude of beach
* Long - Longtitude of beach
* EastITM
* NorthITM
* EastIG
* NorthIG

#The app
The app, like all apps, has to be user friendly, if the user cant use it, it's useless. The app should have a search function, so the user can enter coordinates, latitude, longtitude, beach name, and be able to use their phones gps to search for the nearest beach
